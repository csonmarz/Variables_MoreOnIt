integer initMass
integer growthRate
integer yearsGrow
integer finalMass

initMass = Get next input

//Get growth rate, Ex 0.05 is 5%/year
growthRate= Get next input

yearsGrow= Get next input

//Ex: Rate of 0.05 yields initMass*1.05^yearsGrow
Put " Final mass after " to output

Put yearsGrow to output
Put " years is: " to output
Put finalMass to output
